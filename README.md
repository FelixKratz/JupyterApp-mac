# JupyterApp-mac
This app is a simple standalone application that can run jupyter servers and has some "ease-of-use" features.
If you find bugs (which is very likely) please tell me in the [Issues](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JupyterApp-mac/issues).

## Prerequisites
To install jupyter please follow the guide on https://jupyter.org/install.
For this application to work jupyter must be accessible in a default interactive login shell 
(you can test this by opening a fresh terminal and typing: jupyter --version, you should get a list of components and versions).

## Functionalities
